# autoGithubProjectSummary

The Github's repository summary page is too ugly to use for people
having lots of repostories.  This is a web page authoring tool for
contstructing a new summary page of your own Github's repository by
automatically crawling the latest Github's repository summary page and
constructing a concise presention page.
